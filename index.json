While this is true, our analysis reveals for the first time that these relative scores have a key shortcoming: anomalies have greatly different relative scores if they are located in different regions where the curvatures of the density surface are very different. As a result, the low-score anomalies could be ranked lower than some normal points. This revelation motivates (i) a new score called Neighbourhood Contrast (NC) which produces approximately the same high scores for all anomalies, regardless of varying curvatures of the density surface in different regions; and (ii) an anomaly detection method based on NC. Our experiments show that the proposed method which employs the new score significantly outperforms methods using the aforementioned relative scores on benchmark datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Anomaly Detection via Neighbourhood Contrast","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daqi Liu","Bo Chen","Tat-Jun Chin","Mark Rutten"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588204800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588204800,"objectID":"17badec36e9771d66cc48a304bd02dfd","permalink":"https://bochenys.github.io/publication/topological-sweep/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/topological-sweep/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose an algorithm to detect Geostationary space objects using topological sweep.","tags":null,"title":"Topological Sweep for Multi-Target Detection of Geostationary Space Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Chen","Alvaro Parra","Jiewei Cao","Nan Li","Tat-Jun Chin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"e8a4334fc04ad40f57da51a2f436bd91","permalink":"https://bochenys.github.io/publication/bpnp/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bpnp/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose BPnP, a network module for backpropagation through a PnP optimizer, as if the optimizer were a differentiable function.","tags":null,"title":"End-to-End Learnable Geometric Vision by Backpropagating PnP Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Chen","Jiewei Cao","Alvaro Parra","Tat-Jun Chin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"7e54d1a1fce2f762643cc9edd0883d27","permalink":"https://bochenys.github.io/publication/spe/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spe/","section":"publication","summary":"We proposed an approach to estimate the 6DOF pose of a satellite.

Monitoring Resident Space Objects (RSOs) in GEO is a crucial aspect in achieving Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and in protecting critical space assets. However, ground-based GEO object detection is challenging due to the extreme distance of the targets, as well as nuisance factors including cloud coverage, atmospheric/weather effects, light pollution, sensor noise/defects, and star occlusions. The Kelvins SpotGEO Challenge is designed to establish to what extent images coming from a low-cost ground-based telescope can be used to detect GEO and near-GEO RSOs solely from image sequences that do not carry any additional meta-data. At the same time, the SpotGEO dataset also addresses the lack of publicly available datasets from a computer vision perspective on the satellite detection problem; by assembling and releasing such a dataset, we hope to spur more efforts on the optical detection of RSOs and enable objective benchmarking for existing and future methods.

Existing solutions are mainly based on active sensor-based systems, e.g., the TriDAR system which uses LiDAR. Recently, monocular pose estimation techniques for space applications are drawing significant attention due to their lower power consumption and relatively simple requirements.\nIn this project, we propose an approach to estimate the 6DOF pose of a satellite, relative to a canonical pose, from a single image. Our approach combines machine learning and geometric optimisation, by predicting the coordinates of a set of landmarks in the input image, associating the landmarks to their corresponding 3D points on an a priori reconstructed 3D model, then solving for the object pose using non-linear optimisation. Our approach is not only novel for this specific pose estimation task, which helps to further open up a relatively new domain for machine learning and computer vision, but it also demonstrates superior accuracy and won the first place in the recent Kelvins Pose Estimation Challenge organised by the European Space Agency (ESA).\n","date":1549238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549238400,"objectID":"7fdb29f0a4140dbe0c028909bf31ce50","permalink":"https://bochenys.github.io/project/spe/","publishdate":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/spe/","section":"project","summary":"Estimate the relative attitude and position of a known spacecraft.","tags":["SPE"],"title":"Sattelite Pose Estimation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Bo Chen","Kai Ming Ting","Takashi Washio","Ye Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"cb9dd88d6afb49325a66d8c19731f5b7","permalink":"https://bochenys.github.io/publication/lc/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lc/","section":"publication","summary":"Most density-based clustering methods have difficulties detecting clusters of hugely different densities in a dataset. A recent density-based clustering CFSFDP appears to have mitigated the issue. However, through formalising the condition under which it fails, we reveal that CFSFDP still has the same issue. To address this issue, we propose a new measure called Local Contrast, as an alternative to density, to find cluster centres and detect clusters. We then apply Local Contrast to CFSFDP, and create a new clustering method called LC-CFSFDP which is robust in the presence of varying densities.

The proposed NC admits all local density maxima, regardless of their densities, to have similar NC values. Due to this unique property, NC is a better means to detect clusters in a dataset with large density variations among clusters. We provide two applications of NC. First, replacing density with NC in the current state-of-the-art clustering procedure DP leads to significantly improved clustering performance. Second, we devise a new clustering algorithm called Neighbourhood Contrast Clustering (NCC) which does not require density or distance calculations, and therefore has a linear time complexity in terms of dataset size.

While there are a lot of academic interests, its applications are hampered by the lack of a method which is both robust and efficient. This paper introduces Half-Space Mass which is a significantly improved version of half-space data depth. Half-Space Mass is the only data depth method which is both robust and efficient, as far as we know. We also reveal four theoretical properties of Half-Space Mass\u0026#58; (i) its resultant mass distribution is concave regardless of the underlying density distribution, (ii) its maximum point is unique which can be considered as median, (iii) the median is maximally robust, and (iv) its estimation extends to a higher dimensional space in which the convex hull of the dataset occupies zero volume. We demonstrate the power of Half-Space Mass through its applications in two tasks. In anomaly detection, being a maximally robust location estimator leads directly to a robust anomaly detector that yields a better detection accuracy than half-space depth; and it runs orders of magnitude faster than L2 depth, an existing maximally robust location estimator. In clustering, the Half-Space Mass version of K-means overcomes three weaknesses of K-means.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Half-space mass: a maximally robust and efficient data depth method","type":"publication"}]
